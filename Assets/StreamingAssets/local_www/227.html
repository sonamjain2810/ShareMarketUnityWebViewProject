One must not forget that the present world order has resulted from a historical mishmash of neo liberalism and neo conservatism. While there is widespread anger and condemnation of the intrinsically speculative nature of Western liberal economies, even partially closed ones like India are experiencing the effects of mortgage-backed bubbles and futures trading. While it is a given that capitalism, which has persevered severer shocks in the past and has stood up to other theoretical/ practical alternatives of economic organisation, will weather the storm; it is unclear how the common man will sail through it. Already, wealthy Americans have bore the full brunt of the speculative little adventures of Wall Street honchos and stock markets worldwide are treading an extremely cautious path to an intrepid recovery. In India as well, effects have been felt across the spectrum and the volume of investments has somehow depleted in the past 3 years.

This kind of situation leaves extremely fragile scope for any bloopers as far as the common private investor is concerned. The intermittent slowdowns have brought the stock market to a situation where there is always a danger of a double dip; something which small traders and investors can hardly afford at this juncture. Hence, it is absolutely necessary for them to strategise and plan their tactics before making any investment decisions. And this is possible only when they know how to pick good stocks, based on serious and factual knowledge
