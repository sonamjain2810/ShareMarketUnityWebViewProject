The most important thing to remember before making any kind of investment is the current financial scenario of the investment destination- whether it is bank accounts, fixed deposits or in our case; the stock market. These do not operate in a financial vacuum and are notorious for their illusive speculative-ness and other malpractices. Reading, understanding, observing and internalising market trends is an art- an art which can be perfected only after years of practice, patience and fortitude. It is no child’s play and small investors with no experience of stock trading can be easy target for frauds. Hence, it is extremely necessary that the investor keeps an eye on the share market, learns its operational norms, peculiar institutional behaviour and uninsured risks. Only after the investor, with or without the help of professional advisors, executes this plan of action can he/she hope top make any headway in terms of profits.

However, the ground reality seems to be different. Elated by the realisation that they understand market jargons with the help of written material, investors indulge themselves in ill-advised dealings and end up incurring heavy losses. Therefore, in order to pick good stocks, it is important to read and understand the current market scenario in detail.
