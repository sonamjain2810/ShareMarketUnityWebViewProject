Regardless of their bloopers in the field of international relations, politics and societal issues, Americans have always made important contributions in the field of economics. Whether it is pure economic theory or workable, practical economic models of organisation, that nation has always led the way. Despite the intrinsically oppressive and unstable nature of their international economic policies, the American economic model remains the most popular and most followed paradigm in the world. One of their other major contributions in this regard remain the long term planning for making profits in the stock market, especially when things are dormant and the market looks down.

From the experiences of the recent past, wherein the mortgaged backed securities bubble has deeply checked market buoyancy, it becomes necessary for private investors to understand the contours of institutionally conditioned trends. While stocks are on the upswing, as they were in India in the early years of this century, buyers tend to go with the flow and forget the fact that what goes up; is bound to come down as well. And the pace if it might not necessarily be comfortable to those concerned about maintaining or gaining their profits. Hence, it becomes absolutely essential for them to strategise in the times of upswing and determine ways to make profit from falling stocks as well.
