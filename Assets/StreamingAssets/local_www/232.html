In the current financial scenario, the bear market seems to be always around the corner. The precise meaning of the term is simple- it is a type of negative market trend, which is characterised by a general decline in the share market for successive trading days. During this phase, the investors’ willingness to pump in finances in the stock market declines and is, in effect, replaced by widespread and self-sustaining fear of losing profit/ investments and pessimism. In order to guard themselves from such a situation, smart investors need to follow the above-mentioned strategies to make profit from falling stocks.
