We live in an age of unbridled capitalism, corporatism and privatisation. In such a scenario, speculation has become the keyword for any organized activity, especially if it is related to something as lucrative and temperamental as the stock markets. Throughout the history of this institution, it has endowed men with alternative phases of prosperity and poverty. Whether it is the historic 1865 cotton stock prices crash in Mumbai, the 1928 crash in the U.S. market or the more recent deformations, calling the bluff of speculators has always been tuff for the common investor. Even today, there are several companies in the share market business who regularly pump in huge amount of finances in the market to better their market standing, launch fake public relations campaigns based on false propaganda and grossly overprice their stocks.
