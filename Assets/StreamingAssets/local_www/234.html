There are multi typed and multi thronged strategies for deciding the real value of a stock. Though there is a bewildering multitude, the general ones enumerated in this article can be considered to be standard. First among them is the market review and the analysis of the investment destination’s market standing. While it is relatively easier to gauge the mood among the investors it can be tricky to estimate the stock offering company’s financial potential. However, investors can do so by going through the company’s proclaimed sales turnover and net profit (not gross profit). This will ensure a balanced decision on the investors’ part, except in times of sudden market breakdowns and latent but sharp market corrections. Among connoisseurs of stock market investment, this strategy is considered as the ground rule for guaranteeing financial profit in the long run.

Another supplementary strategy is to analyse the Earnings per Share ratio. The ratio is considered as one of the more reliable indicators of the financial viability of a company and can be relatively easy to internalise. Those companies who declare a high Earnings per Share ratio obviously have a sturdy functional state and are more likely to make profits than those which post low Earnings per Share ratio. However, investors might want to remind themselves that it is not a sole indicator. Only when it is supplanted with a careful consideration of other factors can it be a reflective estimate.
