2011 has been an eventful year indeed. First it was the ‘Jasmine Revolution’ in the North African nation of Tunisia where the 22-year-old dictatorship of Zine El Abidine Ben Ali tasted dust. Then it was the prolonged public protests and demonstrations by the people of Egypt against the tyrannical and authoritarian regime of Hosni Mubarak, which resulted in his resignation. It was followed by the bloody rebellion in oil rich Libya that proved the undoing of elemental socialist tyrant Muammar Gaddafi and the populace in Yemen, Syria and Baharin is still fighting for profound political, economic and social reforms. It seems the whole world has decided to end hypocrisy and parasitical tendencies in their societal existence. The crescendo of this process has been reached in the financial capital of the world superpower- U.S.A.- in the form of ‘Occupy Wall Street’ (OWS) moment in Zuccotti Park.
