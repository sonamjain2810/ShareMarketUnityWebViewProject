The OWS is, in fact, the collective condemnation of corporate greed and share market speculation on the part of Wall Street share brokers. Ever since the so called ‘American monetarist’ policies of Ronald Reagan were implemented, America has been moving towards an increasingly speculative and unstable economy and now the common man in that country has decided to put a stop to this process. However, in India, there is no such bitterness towards desi institutions of stock trading and share brokers, (though scoffed at in certain social circles) aren’t exactly seen as greedy fraudsters. However, that does not mean there are no rotten eggs in the basket. Therefore, in order to make intelligent investments in the stock market and earn profits, investors, whether individuals or collectives, have to understand how to deal with brokers/ sub-brokers in share market.
