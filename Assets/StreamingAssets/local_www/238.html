The stock market is essentially a formalised and closed institution. It might be because it really involves huge amount of financial transactions and symptomatic risks or it might be that the trading and brokering communities, themselves fiercely conservative and closed, do not intend to fritter away their advantageous position. Be as it may, in stock markets around the world, a private individual cannot just jump in to make investments. This can be done only through certain registered and officially recognised brokers who have the license to do so. Hence, stock market brokers are the ones who mediate in the transaction of the investor and the stock market. However, such brokers are involved in high volume trading and often have sub-brokers under their assistance to handle small investors.
