One thing that novices in the field of stocks investment need to understand is, dealing with brokers and sub-brokers in the share market is no child’s play. One cannot simply rely on the judgement of one’s broker or sub-brokers in matters of investment and there has to be thorough background check even when it is safe to do so.
<br />
<br />
For starters, a private investor needs to determine the technical validity of his agent. He or she has to be legally registered with the authorities and should have a proper license to conduct share market transactions on your behalf. The second thing to do is to make the broker or sub-broker sign a registration form for your official professional association. This must be followed by a foolproof and no-nonsense agreement, enumerating minute terms and conditions without any ambiguity. Also, an investor has to demand a contract note or in official parlance, a confirmation memo, for the everyday transaction activity. This is necessary to maintain an accurate record of the transactions made on your behalf. Needless to say, investors also need to ask for pukka bills for transactions wherein transparency with the governing authorities is ensured.
