<p>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">Cash market trading is intended for the people who hope to buy shares with an purpose of taking transport of shares. They need to allocate the full sum towards the purchase of the shares at the time of placing order. This means that the trading account must have adequate funds to take care of the overall cost of the acquisition of the shares, brokerage and additional charges. The shares get carried to the investor&rsquo;s account after the reimbursement process. The investor may the trade the shares on the subsequent trading day, given that the shares are not trade to trade segment. Under this situation, the shares can be sold only after the receipt of the same.</span></p>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:18px;"><strong>Where the cash segment marks -</strong></span></p>
<h4>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">Sum differential:</span></h4>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">It is value noting that the charge of the shares in the cash segment is typically lower than the Future price. So, if it is available for Rs 50 in the Futures segment, one should get it for Rs 48 in the cash segment. Although on events it may even be somewhat greater.</span></p>
<h4>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">Tax:</span></h4>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">In Futures, a trader needs to pay 33% tax on the profit. In equity, it is a flat proportion of 10% (short term capital gains) if trading done is within a year and no tax if sold later a year (long term capital gains).</span></p>
<h4>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">Elasticity in purchases:</span></h4>
<p>
	<span style="font-size:18px;">In the cash segment, one can pick up as many shares one wants starting from just one share. In Futures, a trader cannot buy less than the lot size prescribed. If required to buy more trader can but it must be in multiples of the lot. So one to two contracts can be purchased.</span></p>
