First let us understand what is stock split. A stock split is fundamentally when a firm increases the number of shares. For example if a trader owns 50 shares of a particular company costing Rs.10 Per share and there was a 2-1 stock split, then the owner will own 100 shares worth Rs.5 each. Now everyone will have the doubt in mind that why do these companies issue splits if one still have the same amount of money.
<br />
<br />
The answer to this demand is simple. Some firms believe that their stock ought to be inexpensive so more people can buy it. This creates a circumstance where more of the firm’s stock is bought and sold. This is technically called as “increased liquidity”. The difficulty in theory is that the enlarged movement will also leads to bigger gains and falls in the stock, making it more volatile.
