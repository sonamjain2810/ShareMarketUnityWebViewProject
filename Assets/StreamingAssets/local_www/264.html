As the name implies the trader will pace the order to buy a particular stock at a particular price with the broker for Buy stop order. When this order is given it means that the broker will not buy the stock unless and otherwise the current price reaches the one quoted by the trader. The trader will usually quote a higher price than the prevailing market price. In case the price does not reach the set price then the investor does not do anything at all. This is mainly used by the trader in order to get the advantage of the increasing momentum of a stock. When the price touches the set price the order becomes a simple market order and transaction is completed on the trading day itself.
The trader before placing such order would have done his homework. He would do a detailed research about the past and current performance of the particular stock. Along with this he will also consider the various market indicators and everything goes in favour of the stock and there is trend already set then he might go for this order.

<br />
Though the risk element is little as only if the price reaches a high level set by the trader the transaction is set to happen. But on problem is if the stock reaches the high set price and then immediately drops down due to market volatility then the trader stands to lose money if he had purchased the stock.
