This is a type of order that will enable the trader to limit his risk for a given price range. Though there is an increasing trend in price of stock, market can turn any side at any time. Then in order to just take advantage of the momentum only to the limit of his risk bearing capacity he may issue a buy stop order along with the limit of order. The trader will fix a price range within which the stock could be purchased. This will help him avoid the risk if the broker happens to purchase the stock at extremely high price. This will decrease the risk element to a greater extent especially during high market volatility periods. Rather than giving a single price the trader will fix a price range.
