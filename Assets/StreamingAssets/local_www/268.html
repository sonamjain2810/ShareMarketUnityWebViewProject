Assume a smart, yet crooked fruit vendor. Assume he is the only vendor in a small town so that people don’t have any other resort. During the prime fruit season, he increases the fruits’ prices with increase in demand and people continue to buy fruits from him so that the demand persists. There is an upper break-point limit where people feel or begin to feel that the prices are atrociously high and they would be better off without the fruits. When the vendor increases the fruits’ prices beyond this, demand for the fruits decreases and the vendor incurs loss. A similar scenario exists in share markets. With increase in demand, a stock’s price also increases. The demand is proportional to the trader’s mood. As long as a trader feels that other traders will buy a stock and that its price will increase, he buys it. The buying trend continues till the stock’s price reaches a breaking point. As soon as this break-point is reached, as soon as a trader feels that the stock no longer attracts buyers, he’ll sell it. Once triggered, there can be heavy selling of a stock and its price will plummet in no time.
<br />
<br />
The primary objective of a stock split is to avoid reaching this breaking point. In stock splits, as the number of shares is increased, the share price decreases. For example, if HCL Technologies initially had 1000 shares, each of price Rs.2000. After a 2-for-1 split, there will be 2000 shares each of price Rs.1000. Hence, though the number of shares increases, the market capitalization of the company remains constant. Not only does this ensure safety of a stock against rapid selling, it also increases the demand for the stock.
