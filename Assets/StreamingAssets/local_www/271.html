Every company will have an upward or downward trend in its business activities. Such changes will have an impact on its share value. The term market capitalization refers to the value of a company.  In simple terms it can be calculated for any company using the formula share price multiplied by the outstanding number of shares for a particular company. The market capitalization is a kind of public opinion about the company and its performance.  As the number of shares that is outstanding is considered for finding out the market value you may find that the company whose share value is low will have better market capitalization and vice versa. If the market has a good opinion about a company then the there will be higher market cap and those with negative opinions tend to have lower market cap.
