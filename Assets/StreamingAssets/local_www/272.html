Blue chip companies come under the Big-Cap segment as they are well established and will be the market leaders in all aspects. Such companies are highly reliable and their share price will not be that very volatile. They provide lesser risk investment and the company performance over the last years would be stable giving a better public opinion about the company as a whole. The financial position of the company stands to gain the confidence of the investors. These companies pay their dividend regularly to their shareholders which mean their profitability is steady. Some of the companies that come under this segment will include Reliance Industries Limited, BHEL and also L&T. Such companies will help the investors give a fixed flow of income and is most suited for people who are not ready to take up higher risk.  But during the bull market period you may not able to fetch much returns from the big caps companies as they still grow in the same steady pattern.
