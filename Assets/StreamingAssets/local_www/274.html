Companies that are higher than the smaller companies but lower than the big blue chip companies come under this segment of Mid-Cap. Their financial position though not as stable as the blue chip but still they manage to get positive reviews from the investors and the market. They work on standard and established business models and therefore they have a sustained growth ladder. The main advantage of the companies under this segment is that you will be benefited by the large cap company’s stability and also get the benefits of the growth that pertains to the small cap companies.  These companies will also be able to give you better returns when compared to the big-cap companies. In fact these are the large companies who have not been able to go beyond a certain point and so their performance gets retarded. Similarly the small cap companies are those who are not able to take a big leap though they give the investors the advantages of the growth period.

Having explained all the various market capitalization terminologies it should also be understood that this is not the only criteria that your investment decision should be based upon. Though this forms major part of the decision there are other factors like the company performance, news items that could have an impact on the share price and so on. A cumulative approach and study of all the factors goes a long way in taking the right investment decision.
