We live in an age of unbridled capitalism, consumerism and commercialisation. Ever since the liberal economic reforms in the LPG drive (Liberalisation, Privatisation and Globalisation) of 1991 and the reinforcing neo liberal measures in the UPA 1 and 2 regimes, we have seen the gradual rise of market forces on the nominal socialist economy of our country. Despite several stocks scams and ghapalas, stocks share trading is on the rise, mainly among the Indian middle and upper middle class. Even the great economic slowdown and recession following 2008 has not really reigned in the incessant cash flows (black and white) from institutional and private investors and the speculative game; typical of the share market. Newspapers and media publications have been howling about how the sales of Karl Marx’s ‘Das Kapital’ and other Marxist literature have gone up and how the mushrooming of the Occupy Wall Street movement of Zuccotti park has shook the foundations of capitalism in India and around the world.
<br />
<br />
However, amidst this entire hullabaloo over the demise of capitalism and its self destructing institutions and institutional practices, robust economies like India have come into their own. Their share markets, despite the marginal upheavals caused by the volatility of the world economy, have largely been stable and have not really seen any dramatic loss of income. However, there still remain several inconsistencies and potential minefields which can have a murderous impact on the stability and income generating capacities of stock markets.
