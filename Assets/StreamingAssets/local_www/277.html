The term ‘arbitrage trading’ could be misleading to novices in the field of share stocks trading and hence needs to be defined clearly as to bring out its true meaning and implications for the individual investors, the share market and national economy. Arbitrage trading is a phenomena which comes into play when companies and corporate houses make attempts to raise capital by offering stocks for sale on more than one stock exchange markets in a single country (or theoretically in multiple countries). In those share markets which are not perfect in terms of investment value or price updating facilities, there exists a more than fair chance of discrepancies of share value of the same or closely related shares on different stock markets. When, an investor deliberately invests in the shares of a particular company in one stock market and finding it profitable; sells the same in order to buy the same or closely related shares of the same company or group in another stock market, it is called arbitrage trading. In such a situation, the investor; whether a private individual, a bank or an investment firm, attempts to make profit out of the discrepancies or difference in the price of the shares across different stock exchanges in a single country (or theoretically, in a bunch of countries).
