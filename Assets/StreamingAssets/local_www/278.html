Do not get confused if you do not understand the technical mumbo jumbo regarding arbitrage trading on the internet. To make the readers understand the meaning of the term ‘arbitrage trading’ and to enlighten them on its financial implications, it is necessary to present a practical and relevant example. Let us start with the premise that an investor has 500 shares of Coal India. At a particular point of time during day trading he gets the information that while Coal India is trading at 200 Rs. per share on NSE (National Stock Exchange), it is trading at 250 Rs. per share on BSE (Bombay Stock Exchange). Hence, the investor decides to sell the 500 Coal India shares on the NSE and simultaneously buys back the shares at the BSE. This transaction effectively makes him a profit of – 500*50= 25000. To encapsulate, this is what precisely is arbitrage trading.
<br />
<br />
Fortunately or unfortunately, arbitrage trading is fully legal in India and is in fact one of the main drivers behind the volume of trade on BSE and NSE.
