Ever since the fall of feudalism, capitalism; with its foundational principles of liberal laissez faire government, individual property rights and market driven economy, has been the dominant system of economic organisation the world over. Though many countries in the Asian and African continents still have remnants of the feudal system, a majority of national economies have integrated themselves in the world system of market driven enterprise.
<br />
<br />
Prominent in this system is that American model of finance capitalism which gives almost a complete autonomy to multinational finance capital. The model has been dominant ever since the expansion of American industry in the 19th century. The only real challenge, theoretical as well as practical, to this model was presented by the Marxist school of thought and its practical application in terms of a socialist or a communist economy. Though it started out on the right note, refusing the instability and ‘inherent contradictions’ of a market driven economy, the Marxist model later faltered to reinvent itself in the form of state capitalism as in the case of China and erstwhile Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR).
