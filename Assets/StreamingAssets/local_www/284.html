The fall of the Soviet Empire is said to have exposed the world economy to the mercy of two well known beasts of the market- The bear and the bull. While the former is considered to be ominous to the welfare of common people and investors in particular, the latter is seen as positively beneficial who indulge in stock market investments. However, irrespective of the fact whether the market is showcasing an upward swing (the Bull Market situation) or a downward swing (the Bear Market situation), investors need to be on their tows nevertheless.
<br />
<br />
Especially deceiving is the bull market scenario. Investors, in the frenzy of popular investment enthusiasm and potential profits, tend to forget the fact that trends like the bull market also have their own limitations and can transform themselves into something very dangerous for their investments.
