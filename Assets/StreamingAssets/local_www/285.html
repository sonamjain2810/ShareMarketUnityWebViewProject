Before delving onto the concept of bull market, it is necessary to understand its financial moorings. This necessitates us to understand the very meaning and nature of the phenomenon of a ‘market trend’ and it’s long and short term variants. A market trend is the supposed streak within a financial or more particularly a stock market to move in a particular direction. In simple words, it is an apparently predictable price tendency in a share market depending upon the market situation. Now market tendencies can be broadly classified into ‘secular market trends’ for long term time spans, ‘primary market trends’ for medium term time spans and ‘secondary market trends’ for short term time spans. A secular market trend lasts for a period anywhere between 5 to 25 years and constitutes of a number of primary trends. On the other hand, primary trends lasts for one year or more, whereas, secondary trends last for a few weeks or a few months.

Bull market is a type of primary market trend. It involves increasing confidence on the part of investors; whether institutional or private, in the profitability of investment in the share market. This leads to actual increase in the investment in company stocks in anticipation of further price increase, culminating in a general upward trend in the market as a whole. Though it is primarily used for share market situations it is not limited to only that and can also be applied to currency, bonds and the commodities market. A classic example of the bull market trend is period between 2003 and 2008 during which the Bombay Stock Exchange went through a bull market phase, increasing from a mere 2,900 points to a staggering 21,000 points.
