The current generation lives in an era in which phenomena called ‘market trends’ and ‘market forces’ dictate the terms of the operation of national economies. It all started in the aftermath of the introduction of perestroika and glasnost by the last Soviet premier Mikhail Gorbachev. Both the policy packages, while meant to reform the inherent deformations, dependencies and vulnerabilities of a closed communist economy, in effect exposed the very contradictions of the Marxist economics theory. This was followed by a series of uprisings against the autocratic Soviet power, the fall of the Berlin Wall being the single most monumental revolt against Russian oppression. This, not surprisingly, led to the further weakening of the Soviet economy and ultimately culminated in the fall of the Union of Socialist Republics.

Though the soviet power was indeed based on oppression of the economic and political rights of its block, it was the only alternative model of economic organization to have challenged the American order. The resultant, New World Order brought with it the inconsistent and volatile system of market controlled economy wherein the larger populace was left exposed to the market machinations of the corporate sector. Even in India, ‘market trends’ have become the main drivers of the income generation capacity of our industrial and service sector and the multitude of small and medium investors are perilously left at the mercy of the same trends. Hence it becomes necessary for them to understand the contours of share market investments and learn to manage during the Bear Market period.
