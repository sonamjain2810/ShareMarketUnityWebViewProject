Before delving into the more detailed term of Bear Market trend, it is absolutely essential for investors to understand the true meaning and nature of the term ‘market trend’ as well as different types of its short and long term variants. The term ‘market trend’ is somehow vaguely defined. It is the supposed streak within a financial or more particularly a stock market to move in a particular direction. In simple words, it is an apparently predictable price tendency in a share market depending upon the market situation.
<br />
<br />
Now market tendencies can be broadly classified into ‘secular market trends’ for long term time spans, ‘primary market trends’ for medium term time spans and ‘secondary market trends’ for short term time spans. A secular market trend lasts for a period anywhere between 5 to 25 years and constitutes of a number of primary trends. On the other hand, primary trends lasts for one year or more, whereas, secondary trends last for a few weeks or a few months.

<br />
Bear Market is a type of primary market trend. It is characterized by a general decline in the share market for successive trading days during which investors’ confidence and willingness to pump in money in the stock market is replaced by widespread and self sustaining fear of losing profit/ investments and pessimism on the part of investors. As the prices of stocks and securities come down, the pessimism within the investor’s community further grows and reinforces the tendency to avoid making large investments and taking risks. This, in effect, results in the arrival and settling in of a bear market scenario. Bear Markets are usually the result of recession, industrial slowdown or stagnation, continual inflation and a high rate of unemployment.
