Bear Market is an extremely dangerous time for investors. While established shareholders have a slight chance of wriggling out of the situation without monumental losses, new traders tend to get affected badly because of it. It is necessary to make a distinction between a bear market situation and a ‘correction’ within the market. When the prices of stocks fall for a short period of time and then appreciate for a long time; it is called a ‘correction’. Whereas a correction is deemed to be a great entry time for new investors, doing so in a bear market situation can be immensely problematic.
<br />
<br />
Hence it is necessary for all investors to understand the logic and operation of bear market trends and guard against making intemperate decisions during such periods.
