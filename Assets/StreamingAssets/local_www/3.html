Being an Owner Holding a company&#39;s stock means that you are one of the many owners (shareholders) of a company and, as such, you have a claim (albeit usually very small) to everything the company owns. Yes, this means that technically you own a tiny sliver of every piece of furniture, every trademark, and every contract of the company. As an owner, you are entitled to your share of the company&#39;s earnings as well as any voting rights attached to the stock.<br />
<br />
A stock is represented by a stock certificate. This is a fancy piece of paper that is proof of your ownership. In today&#39;s computer age, you won&#39;t actually get to see this document because your brokerage keeps these records electronically, which is also known as holding shares &quot;in street name&quot;. This is done to make the shares easier to trade. In the past, when a person wanted to sell his or her shares, that person physically took the certificates down to the brokerage. Now, trading with a click of the mouse or a phone call makes life easier for everybody.
