A contract in futures is an agreement between two parties regarding the sale and purchase of shares of a company at a future time. The intriguing part of the deal is that although the share will change hands in the future the price between the two parties is arrived at in the present. The day the shares will change ownership is called the delivery date.
<br />
<br />
The buyer in this case expects the price of the share to rise in the future, while the seller feels that the share will fall in the days leading to the delivery date. In this case both are speculating on making a profit on the price they have settled in the present. In this case the buyer has a long position while the seller has a short position. The trade can be done in shares as well as in commodities.
<br />
<br />
A big aspect of understanding ‘what is Nifty futures‘ is that the National Stock Exchange is the intermediary in this contract. This is enforced through margin money kept with the NSE on behalf of both the buyer and the seller. Daily fluctuations make a profit for one party and a loss for the other party. The difference is credited to the account of the party making the profit. In this way the accounts are maintained in a regular way till the delivery date.
<br />
<br />
It is truly difficult to learn ‘what is Nifty futures’ without having some hands on practical experience. Buying, selling, margin money, delivery, long and short are part of the terminology used in these futures trades.
