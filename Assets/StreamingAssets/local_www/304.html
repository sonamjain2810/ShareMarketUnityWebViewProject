Nifty Future trading is done over a cycle of three months. The first month is the near month, the second is the next month and the third is far month. For example, if Nifty Future is done in October, November and December, then, October will be the first month as it is the near one, November will be the second month as it is the next month and December will be the third one as it is the far month. The settlement day of nifty future is the last Thursday of the expiry month. If we take the above example, the settlement day will be the last Thursday of December month. What if the last Thursday is a national holiday? In such a situation, the last trading day will be the settlement day.

<br />
Nifty Futures trading is less volatile and provides greater flexibility. It is less volatile as compared to individual stock because a change in one or two stocks does not affect much. It provides greater flexibility in the sense that it is easy to trade, hold or get out of the marketplace. Also, while trading in nifty futures, you pay less brokerage. Moreover, the daily turnover in nifty futures is 2-3 times that of individual stocks. You can invest more as nifty margins are the lowest.
