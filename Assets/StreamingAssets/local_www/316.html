<span style="font-size:18px;">The extent of documentation required to open a demat account may vary according to your relationship with the institution. If you plan to open a demat account with a bank, a savings, current and, or other account for which the holder have been issued a check book, such holder has an edge over the non-account holder. In fact, banks usually offer additional incentives to customers who open a demat account with them. Along with the application form, your photographs (with co-applicants) and proof of identity/residence/date of birth have to be submitted. The DPs also ask for a DP-client agreement to be executed on non-judicial stamp paper. Here is a broad list:<br />
<br />
- A canceled check, preferably MICR<br />
- Proof of Identification<br />
- Proof of Address<br />
- Proof of Pan card (mandatory)<br />
- Recent photographs, one and, or more<br />
<br />
For proof of identification and, or address self-attested facsimile copies of PAN card, Voter&rsquo;s ID, Passport, Ration card, Driver&rsquo;s license, Photo credit card, Employee ID card, Bank attestation, latest IT returns and, or latest Electricity/Landline phone bill are sufficient. While they only ask for photocopies of the documents, they will need the originals for verification. </span>
